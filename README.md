This code was written as part of a research project examining the effect of the COVID-19 lockdowns on the price and quantity of agricultural commodities in the agricultural wholesale markets of India. This project was done through the Advanced Authentic Research program at Gunn High School, and the code has been put here to assist with replicating the analysis. The data for this project was taken from this Kaggle dataset by Vandeet Shah linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vandeetshah/india-commodity-wise-mandi-dataset/data. This dataset was used as a substitute for using data directly from the AGMARKNET website, as the website is currently down.
